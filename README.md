# satnet-fineet-satellite_image-imputations
 This is the source code of Mind the Gap: Generating Imputations for Satellite Data Collections at Myriad Spatiotemporal Scopes. We propose a method based on Generative Adversarial Network, SATnet, to capture and model relationships between a sequence of imageries and ancillary datasets. Our approximate query leverages models to generate imagery for gaps in satellite scanning frequencies.
